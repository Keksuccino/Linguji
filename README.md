# Lingudai

_**lingua** ( /ˈlin.ɡwa/ ) : Italian for "language"._<br>
_**fukudai** ( /ˈlin.ɡwa/ ) : Japanese for "subtitle"._

<br>

Lingudai is a Gemini-powered AI subtitle file translator.

It currently supports only ASS files and can batch-translate them from a source language to a target language while trying to preserve its text formatting as good as possible. It has a pretty advanced error handling and tries to keep the translation process going by working around various types of errors and trying to adapt its translation process to not trigger the same error again, like changing the **safety threshold** after a prompt or answer was blocked for profanity/safety reasons.
